# SQL-Proj-Telemedicine-Integrated-Online-Pharmacy
- This project simulates a telemedicine platform integrated with an online pharmacy, offering virtual consultations,               prescription management, and seamless pharmacy integration for better healthcare delivery.
- I designed a relational SQL database using MySQL Workbench with a star schema to improve data organization, ensuring seamless integration between telemedicine services and an online pharmacy.
- I further developed and executed advanced SQL queries in Microsoft SQL Server to extract critical insights, optimizing platform efficiency and enhancing clinical decision support.
- Tools used include MSSQL Workbench for creation of the model.
